  {
    version: "1.9.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [
      "New: soft-prompt update popup — checks for a newer deployed version every minute (and whenever the tab regains focus), showing an \"Update now / Wait\" popup rather than forcing a reload",
      "Nothing is interrupted if you pick 'Wait' — finish your round, come back to it whenever",
      "public/version.json is now auto-generated from CURRENT_VERSION on every build — one source of truth, no manual step",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.8.1",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [
      "Fixed: flags now render as real images (via a flag CDN) instead of emoji — Windows doesn't ship flag emoji glyphs, so they were showing as plain two-letter codes",
      "Native country changed from a button grid to a searchable dropdown, now listing all ~195 countries instead of just Spanish/English-speaking ones",
      "Same for the flag-avatar picker in Profile picture settings — full country list, real flag image preview",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.8.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [

      "Skill levels added to every track (No experience/Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Native), based on the real CEFR framework (A1-C2)",
      "Every existing question (~90 across all 4 tracks) tagged with a CEFR difficulty level",
      "Rounds now bias toward your current skill level without ever leaving a round short on content",
      "Accuracy tracking + a \"ready to advance?\" prompt once you're consistently doing well at your level",
      "New placement quiz (per track) for anyone unsure where they fall — untimed, samples across difficulty tiers",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.7.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [
      "\"Signed in as\" now shows your username if you've set one, otherwise your email",
      "Profile pictures: upload a photo, pick a generic icon, or use a country flag as your avatar (Settings → Profile picture)",
      "Added a Native country setting; combined with native language, infers a regional label + flag (e.g. Spanish + Venezuela → \"Español (Latinoamérica)\" 🇻🇪) shown on the home screen just above the version tag",
      "Split the English track into English (US) and English (UK) — genuinely distinct content: different everyday vocabulary, idioms, and non-rhotic phonetics for UK",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.6.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [

    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.5.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [
      "Database schema changes can now deploy automatically on git push (GitHub Action + Supabase CLI), instead of manual copy-paste into the SQL Editor",
      "Converted the schema into a proper migrations history (supabase/migrations/) — schema.sql kept as a manual-fallback reference",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.4.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [
      "Current-password re-entry required before changing email or password in Settings",
      "Show/hide toggle (eye icon) on every password field, app-wide",
      "Password strength meter while typing a new password",
      "Changing your password now signs out any other devices you're logged in on elsewhere, for security",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.3.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [
      "Friendlier color palette (warm plum/pink instead of the original near-black HUD look)",
      "Animated per-track background themes; home screen cycles seamlessly through all of them",
      "Settings moved behind a gear icon on the home screen (with hover tooltip)",
      "Added a version log and version tag (this page!)",

    version: "1.2.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",

      "All account settings (username, email, password, native language) editable via an Edit/Save/Cancel pattern",

    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.1.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",
    changes: [
      "Native/base language selection moved out of sign-up, chosen on first home-screen load instead",
      "Bubble-style picker for target language, filtered by native language",
      "Added Spain (Castilian) Spanish as its own track — vosotros, distinción, peninsular vocabulary",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "1.0.0",
    date: "2026-07-05",

      "Full Latin American Spanish track, ported from the original prototype",
      "Starter English (for Spanish speakers) track",
      "Mixed rounds: vocab, verbs, translation, phonetics (readable respelling, not IPA)",
      "Missed-question review mode, with bilingual explanations",
      "Explanation history + archive (paginated, never silently deleted)",
      "\"Don't repeat too soon\" freshness rotation across questions",
