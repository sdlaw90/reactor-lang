// Bump CURRENT_VERSION and add an entry here whenever you ship a meaningful
// change. Shown as a small tag in the footer, linking to the full changelog.
//
// STANDING PRACTICE: whenever a change here affects anything a person would
// notice or need explained (a new setting, a new page, a changed icon/label,
// a changed flow), also update app/help/page.js in the same pass. The Help
// page fell out of sync with reality once already (see the 2026-07-06 "Help
// page revisit" entry below) — treat keeping it current as part of shipping
// the feature, not a follow-up task.

      "Placement quiz is now much more comprehensive: samples all six CEFR tiers (A1-C2) instead of just the middle four, with 3 questions per tier instead of 2 — should place true beginners and advanced learners more accurately, not just people in the B1-C1 middle",

      "Redesigned the squirrel logo/favicon with a proper body, two-tone ears, a more natural curled tail, and a little paw — replacing the simpler head-and-tail-only version",

      "Language bubbles are more compact and denser, each now showing a small illustrated icon for its country/region (Statue of Liberty for US, Big Ben for UK, Spain's flag, a sun motif for Latin America)",
      "Native English speakers (not based in the UK) can now also learn English (UK) — its content is genuinely comparative (British vs. American), so prompts, category labels, and the sublabel automatically switch to English-native phrasing instead of the Spanish-learner phrasing used for the track's original audience",

      "Removed the redundant large avatar from the welcome header (profile picture already shows via the Settings icon)",
      "\"Pick your next quick win\" is now noticeably bigger and bolder",
      "Help page revisited top to bottom: now covers the category picker, review mode, configurable rounds/timer, required usernames + verify/alternatives, onboarding, and the grouped Settings sections — all previously undocumented",

      "New Help page (? icon on home screen) — a full walkthrough covering icons, language selection, rounds, missed-question review, explanations/archive, skill levels, profile pictures, and account security",
      "Native country and flag-avatar pickers are now searchable dropdowns — full list shown by default, filters live as you type",
      "Simplified language cards on the home screen: just skill level + XP progress now, no more sublabel text clutter",

      "README: clarified that Supabase's built-in email service only delivers to your own account's team members by default (not the public), which is the real cause behind both \"can't sign up\" and \"email rate limit exceeded\" — fix is turning off email confirmation for sign-up, and optionally configuring custom SMTP (via your existing Resend account) for password-reset emails too",
